// SmileyGroup is going to be specifying (to other methods) the 
// colors various smaily face parts ought to be, so we need to 
// have the Color library available:

import java.awt.Color;

// The predefined Colors (they are final Color objects) are
//		BLACK, BLUE, CYAN, GRAY, DARK_GRAY, LIGHT_GRAY, GREEN, MAGENTA,
//		ORANGE, PINK, RED, WHITE, YELLOW


// A SmileyGroup represents a collection of up to three smiley faces,
// each with its own attributes.

public class SmileyGroup
{
	// Provide fields for the three smiley faces that make up the group
	

	// The constructor builds up to three smileys in the group.  You
	// can construct each face either from scratch or as a copy of an
	// existing one, setting the attributes of the various face parts,
	// translating and/or scaling face parts, or translating the
	// entire smiley face, by calling the appropriate methods.
	//
	// See the lab write-up for the kinds of smiley faces we're expecting
	// you to create and the methods we expect you to employ; withint those
	// requirements, the exact characteristics (shape, color, position) of 
	// each smiley is up to you.
	
	public SmileyGroup()
	{
		// *** code that implements this method goes here***	
	}
	
	
	
	// Obtain the first smiley face of the group
	public SmileyFace getSmiley1()
	{
		// *** code that implements this method goes here***	
	}
	
	
	// Obtain the second smiley face of the group
	public SmileyFace getSmiley2()
	{
		// *** code that implements this method goes here***	
	}
	
	
	// Obtain the third smiley face of the group
	public SmileyFace getSmiley3()
