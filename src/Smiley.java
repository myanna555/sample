// This is where the program begins. 
// We construct a SmileyFrame (i.e., the window that holds
// the display areas where the smiley group is dawn);
// we construct a smiley group to display in it;
// we add that group into the frame.
// The provided graphics routines take over from there
// --they are called via SmileyGroupDisplay --
// and draw in the frame the graphics objects that, taken
// together, appear to the user as a group of smiley faces.
// We then make the frame visible, so the user can see the 
// drawn group.

		f.add(new SmileyGroupDisplay(new SmileyGroup()));
